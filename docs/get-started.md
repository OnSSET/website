# Get started

You can start with OnSSET in three ways: explore results, run locally, or follow guided learning.

## 1. Explore results first (no installation)
If you want to see outputs before running the model:

- [Global Electrification Platform (interactive results)](https://electrifynow.energydata.info/)
- [GEP datasets (58 countries)](https://energydata.info/group/gep)

## 2. Run OnSSET locally
You can experiment with the released code:

- [OnSSET main repository](https://github.com/OnSSET/onsset)
- [All OnSSET related repositories](https://github.com/orgs/OnSSET/repositories)
