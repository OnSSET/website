# Get started

This page helps you start using **OnSSET** quickly, either by exploring existing results/data (fastest) or running the tool locally.

## Option A — Fastest: explore data and results first (no install)
If you want to understand what OnSSET produces before running anything:
- Global Electrification Platform (interactive): https://electrifynow.energydata.info/
- Sample datasets (GEP, 58 countries): https://energydata.info/group/gep

## Option B — Run OnSSET locally (recommended for modelling work)
### 1) Get the code
- Main repository: https://github.com/OnSSET/onsset

### 2) Install Python requirements
Follow the repository instructions for the most up-to-date setup.

If you are using conda, create a clean environment first (example):
- Create a new env (Python 3.10+)
- Install dependencies as described in the repo README / docs

### 3) Run a first example
Start with the example notebooks/workflow in the main repository:
- https://github.com/OnSSET/onsset

## Option C — Learn with guided material
- OpenLearn course: https://www.open.edu/openlearncreate/course/view.php?id=16177
- Teaching kit: https://onsset.github.io/teaching_kit/
