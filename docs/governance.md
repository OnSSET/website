# Governance

OnSSET is guided by an open, community-driven governance structure that combines academic leadership, institutional partners, and practitioner input.

Development priorities and strategic direction are shaped through annual Steering Committees and ongoing community engagement.

## Steering Committee

The OnSSET Steering Committee provides strategic oversight and helps define development priorities. It includes representatives from academia, policy institutions, and partner organisations.

## Transparency and Open Modelling

OnSSET development and application align with the **U4RIA principles** for open energy modelling:

- **Ubuntu** – collaborative and community-oriented  
- **Retrievability** – accessible documentation and inputs  
- **Reusability** – adaptable and transparent workflows  
- **Repeatability** – reproducible results  
- **Interoperability** – compatibility with other tools  
- **Auditability** – traceable assumptions and methods  

We encourage all users to apply these principles in their own modelling work.
