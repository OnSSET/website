## Structured Learning Path

### 1️⃣ Introductory Level — Foundations

[OpenLearn Course](https://www.open.edu/openlearncreate/course/view.php?id=16177)  
For users new to electrification modelling or spatial planning.

This course introduces:

- Core electrification planning concepts  
- Geospatial least-cost modelling  
- OnSSET workflow fundamentals  
- Interpretation of model results  

---

### 2️⃣ Applied Level — Hands-on Use

[OnSSET Main Repository](https://github.com/OnSSET/onsset)  
Includes example workflows and notebooks for users ready to run scenarios and interpret outputs.

Recommended progression:

1. Run a baseline scenario
